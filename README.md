## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajat-wyrm/InternOps.git
cd InternOps
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your credentials (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)), then run migrations and seed the database:

```bash
npm run migrate
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

### 3. Set up the frontend

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env`, then start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open the app

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable           | Description                           | Example                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| PORT               | Backend server port                   | 5001                                                |
| NODE_ENV           | Application environment               | development                                         |
| DATABASE_URL       | PostgreSQL database connection string | postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/internops |
| JWT_SECRET         | Secret key for JWT access tokens      | your-jwt-secret                                     |
| JWT_REFRESH_SECRET | Secret key for JWT refresh tokens     | your-refresh-secret                                 |

### Complete Environment Variables

All backend environment variables are available in:

```text
backend/.env.example
```

The file is organized into the following sections:

- Core App Config
- Seed Admin Credentials
- Authentication
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- Google OAuth
- Fast2SMS
- AI Services
- Email (SMTP)
- Redis (Upstash)
- AI Cache
- AI Chat Daily Limit

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `.env` and replace the example values with your own credentials before starting the application.

### Redis

Redis is **optional for local development**.

When Redis is available, Redis-dependent features such as distributed rate limiting, session caching, and WebSocket coordination are enabled.

If Redis is unavailable, the backend continues running in **degraded mode**. The application logs the affected features clearly at startup and uses fallback behavior where supported.

Degraded features may include:

- Rate limiting may use in-memory storage.
- Session caching may be disabled or use fallback storage.
- WebSocket coordination may run in local/in-process mode.

## Troubleshooting

### Backend does not start

- Make sure all required environment variables are configured in `backend/.env`.
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Verify that the configured port is not already in use.

### Frontend cannot connect to backend

- Ensure the backend server is running.
- Verify the API base URL in `frontend/.env`.
- Confirm the backend and frontend ports match the README instructions.

### Database connection issues

- Verify the `DATABASE_URL` is correct.
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
- Run database migrations before starting the application.

### Login issues

- Run the seed command to create the default admin account.
- Check that the backend server is running successfully.
- Verify the credentials configured in the environment variables.
